# Lab 8: Detect User Language

In this lab we will add the ability for your bot to detect languages from user input.

## Introduction

If you have trained your bot or integrated it with QnA Maker but have only done so using one particular language, then it makes sense to inform users of that fact. By recognizing a user is speaking a language you don't support, you can inform them right away of that fact and possibly redirect them to a live person.
